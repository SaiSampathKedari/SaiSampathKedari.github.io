I am a recent graduate from the University of Michigan, where I completed dual masterâ€™s degrees in Mechanical and Automotive Engineering. My academic focus has been on control theory, statistical inference, and optimization, all aimed at building reliable, intelligent robotic systems.

Over the last year, I have dedicated myself to building a strong mathematical foundation for robotics. I have independently studied and solved major texts in Probability and Distribution Theory, Statistical Inference (Casella & Berger), Convex Optimization (Boyd), Real Analysis (Ross), Functional Analysis, Matrix Methods, Fourier Transforms, and Signals and Systems (Oppenheim), documenting much of this work publicly. This process has reinforced my belief that mathematical clarity is essential to building intelligent and reliable robotic systems.

Before graduate school, I worked as a C++ software developer for two years, where I worked on large-scale systems and gained practical experience in performance-oriented programming â€” a foundation I now build on to implement mathematically sound algorithms in robotics.

My interests lie in solving core challenges in robotics, particularly state estimation, control, and motion planning under uncertainty. Iâ€™m drawn to the convergence of inference, optimization, and dynamics, and aspire to design systems that are both theoretically principled and robust in the real world.
